This program was created to facilitate the study and analysis of molecular dynamics without the need for programming. It has the advantage of being able to analyze very large dynamics, which would not fit in memory for a traditional analysis.

This program is contained within a Docker container, and mostly uses VMD to perform the analysis. Both are not provided by us and must be obtained and installed separately. 

With this program you will be able to perform analysis of **RMS**, **contacts between chains**, **distances**, **SASA**, **BSA** and **energies**. Currently it only supports Gromacs and NAMD dynamics. 


## Installation
This program requires Docker and VMD installed to run. After you installed the dependencies you can run it with the following commands:

```shell
wget http://biodados.icb.ufmg.br/nome_legal/nome_legal
chmod -x nome_legal
./nome_legal -h
```

A fully installation guide and **documentation** can be found on our home page [here](http://biodados.icb.ufmg.br/nome_legal/).
